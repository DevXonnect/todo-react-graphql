# todo-react-graphql
TODO project made with React, Redux, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL

## How to run this code

First of all, download or clone this repository.

After that, go to the project folder and type this on command line:

Open 2 terminals on project root folder.

In the first terminal, type:
```

```

In the second terminal, type:

A new window should open in your default browser and you can play around with my app.
